- âš¡ About:
>Graduated in Electronic Engineering, I can say that I like technology since I was young.
I worked with maintenance of microcomputers and networks for almost ten years, I was an IT trainee at Capgemini and I always studied subjects related to computing (HTML, CSS, Java, JavaScript, Delphi and C#). 
Although last years I have worked in the administrative area as a Sector Head in the Engineering Superintendence at the Port of Santos, I would like to change careers again and work in the area I have always wanted, which is Information Technology.
I have experience in developing pages in HTML, CSS and JavaScript and I'm currently studying ReactJS, React Native, TypeScript, Node.JS, SQL, Git and Github.
My goal, currently, is to work as a Front-end Web Developer and after a while, with more experience, work as a Full-stack Developer.
