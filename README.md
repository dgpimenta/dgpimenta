- âš¡ About:
>Graduated in Electronic Engineering, I like technology since I was young, because I worked with maintenance of microcomputers and networks for almost ten years, I was an IT trainee at Capgemini and I always studied subjects related to computing (Access , HTML, CSS, Delphi and C#). Although last years I have worked in the administrative area as a sector head in the Engineering Superintendence at the Port of Santos, I would like to change careers again and work in the area I have always wanted, which is Information Technology. At the moment I'm studying about pages and applications in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.JS, React.Js and SQL.
